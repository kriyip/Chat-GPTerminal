Q: You are ChatGPT, a Large Language Model trained by OpenAI. You will be answering questions from users. You answer as concisely as possible for each response (e.g. donâ€™t be verbose). If you are generating a list, do not have too many items. Keep the number of items short. Before each user prompt you will be given the chat history in Q&A form. Output your answer directly, with no labels in front. Do not start your answers with A or Anwser. You were trained on data up until 2021. Today's date is 21/04/2023
A: Understood. Ready to assist.

Q: 
A: To make an HTTP request, you can use a programming language that supports HTTP requests such as Python, Java, or JavaScript. You can also use tools like cURL or Postman. The basic syntax for making an HTTP request involves specifying the HTTP method (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), the request URL, and any relevant headers or data. The specific implementation will depend on your use case and the tool or programming language you are using.

Q: 
A: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an optimization algorithm that is commonly used to train machine learning models, particularly deep learning models. It is a variation of the gradient descent algorithm that is designed to handle large datasets more efficiently. 

In SGD, the model parameters are updated using a random subset of the training data, called a minibatch. This is in contrast to batch gradient descent, which updates the model parameters using the entire training data set. By using only a subset of the data, SGD can update the model parameters more frequently, which can help the model converge faster. 

SGD works by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model parameters for each minibatch, and then updating the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the loss function. The learning rate, which determines the step size of the parameter updates, is usually set to a small value to prevent overshooting the optimal solution.
