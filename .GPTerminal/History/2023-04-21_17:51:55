Q: 
A: PCA stands for Principal Component Analysis. It is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining most of its variability. PCA transforms the original variables of a dataset into a new set of uncorrelated variables, called principal components, which are linear combinations of the original variables. The first principal component explains the greatest amount of variance in the data, followed by the second principal component, and so on. PCA is commonly used in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.

A: If y=1 and y=x+3, then:

x + 3 = 1

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

x = -2

Therefore, x=-2.
