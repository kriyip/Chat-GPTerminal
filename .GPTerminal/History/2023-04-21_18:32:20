Q: 
A: Here's a short poem about Linux:

In lines of code, it was born,
An operating system, forlorn,
A community took it to heart,
And breathed new life, a work of art.

With open source as its core,
It spread its wings, and so much more,
A world of power, for all to see,
The beauty of Linux, forever free.
