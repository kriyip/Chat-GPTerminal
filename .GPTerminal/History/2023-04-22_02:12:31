Q: i would like a poem 
A: In the stillness of the night,
When the world is fast asleep,
The stars come out to play,
And the moon begins to creep.

The breeze whispers in my ear,
As I lay in my bed,
And I drift off into a dream,
With the stars above my head.

The night is full of wonders,
And the sky is a canvas of art,
Each star a shining beacon,
Guiding me through the dark.

So let me close my eyes,
And let the night take me away,
To a world of magic and wonder,
Where the stars forever stay.
