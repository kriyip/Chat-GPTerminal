Q: 
A: PCA stands for Principal Component Analysis, which is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving as much of the variation in the data as possible. PCA transforms the original data into a new coordinate system where the first coordinate (principal component) explains the largest possible variance in the data, the second coordinate explains the second largest variance, and so on. By discarding the least important coordinates, PCA can help to reduce the complexity of the data and make it easier to analyze.
