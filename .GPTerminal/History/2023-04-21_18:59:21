Q: 
A: Here's a short poem about Linux:

In the world of computers so vast,
A system stands out unsurpassed,
It's open-source, free for all,
Linux is its name, hear it call.

From servers to mobile phones,
It runs with speed, and never groans,
Stable, secure, and oh so slick,
Linux is the system that does the trick.

So if you're looking for a change,
And want a system that's truly strange,
Give Linux a try, it won't disappoint,
It's the system that's truly anointed.
