Q: 
A: Here's a short poem about the beauty of nature:

Nature's Beauty

The world is full of wonder,
In every tree and flower.
The colors of the rainbow,
Are found in every hour.

The gentle breeze that whispers,
The rustling of the leaves.
The birds that sing so sweetly,
As they flutter through the trees.

The mountains and the valleys,
The oceans and the seas.
The beauty of the sunset,
As it fades into the breeze.

The world is full of magic,
In every corner, every nook.
And all of this is waiting,
For you to take a look.
