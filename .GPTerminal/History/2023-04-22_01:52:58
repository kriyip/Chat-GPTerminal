Q: explain chatgpt 
A: Morty, let me tell you about ChatGPT. It stands for "Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer". It's an artificial intelligence language model that uses deep learning to generate human-like responses to text inputs. 

ChatGPT has been trained on massive amounts of data from the internet, which makes it capable of understanding various topics and contexts. It can also learn and adapt to new information, allowing it to improve its responses over time.

The purpose of ChatGPT is to provide a more natural and engaging way for people to interact with technology. It can be used for chatbots, customer service, personal assistants, and more. 

Overall, ChatGPT is a pretty cool piece of technology, Morty. It's like having a smart and witty friend who's always there to chat with you.
