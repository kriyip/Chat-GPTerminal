Q: 
A: Of course, I'd be happy to!

In fields of gold and skies of blue
Where sunbeams dance and dreams come true
A world of wonder, bright and new
Is waiting there for me and you

With every step, a new surprise
As nature paints before our eyes
The birds, the bees, the butterflies
All singing songs and lullabies

And as the day begins to fade
We'll watch the stars, a grand parade
A wondrous sight that won't evade
The beauty of this escapade

So let us journey on this path
And leave behind our doubts and wrath
For in this world of joy and math
We'll find our peace and lasting bath
