Q: 
A: Leaves rustling in the gentle breeze,
Tall and sturdy, branches at ease,
The trees stand proud, rooted deep,
A sight to behold, a beauty to keep.

Their trunks tell stories of long ago,
Of seasons passed and seeds that grow,
Their branches reach for the sky,
A home for birds that soar high.

In spring, they blossom and bloom,
In summer, they provide cool shade room,
In autumn, they dazzle with colors bright,
In winter, they stand tall, a snowy white.

Oh, trees, how much we owe,
For the air we breathe, and nature's show,
A symbol of life and hope,
A reminder of the beauty that nature can evoke.
