Q: write me a poem 
A: The sun sets on the horizon,
A gentle breeze blows through the trees,
The world is calm and quiet,
And I am filled with peace.

The stars twinkle in the sky,
A symphony of light,
And as I gaze up at them,
I am filled with wonder and delight.

The moon rises in the east,
A glowing orb of white,
And as it casts its light upon me,
I am filled with hope and might.

For in this moment of beauty,
I am reminded of the grace,
That fills this world with wonder,
And makes my heart race.

So let us cherish these moments,
Of peace and wonder and light,
For they are the treasures of life,
That make our spirits take flight.
