Q: 
A: Here's a short poem about Linux:

In the world of code and command,
A system reigns with open hand,
Where users gather to create,
And share their knowledge, so innate. 

With lines of text and endless power,
Linux runs with every hour,
A world of freedom, open-source,
Where all can join without remorse.

From server rooms to desktop screens,
Linux is more than just a dream,
For those who seek a better way,
Linux is the light of day.

Q: 
A: Clear as the sky on a summer day,
Pure as the water in a mountain stream,
Simple as a child's innocent play,
Free as the birds in a sun-kissed dream.

Clear as the truth that must be told,
Bright as a diamond in the light,
Calm as the ocean, deep and old,
True as the stars that shine at night.

Clear as a bell that rings out strong,
Warm as the sun on a golden beach,
Hopeful as a new day's dawn,
Beautiful as a rose within reach.
