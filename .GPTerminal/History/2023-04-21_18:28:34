Q: 
A: Here's your poem about the Linux terminal:

In black and white, it blinks and waits,
A portal to a world of gates,
Commands and code, it understands,
And faithfully obeys our demands.

With keystrokes deft and fingers quick,
We navigate through files and tricks,
Directories and paths galore,
All at our fingertips in this core.

We summon tools and scripts with ease,
Our tasks and queries it will appease,
And when we're done, we bid adieu,
Until the next time we need it to do.

Oh, Linux terminal, how we admire,
Your power and flexibility, never to tire,
You are the gateway to a digital land,
And with you, we can accomplish all we've planned.
