Q: 
A: Alright, here's a short poem I came up with:

The sky above is painted blue,
A canvas vast and true,
Clouds drift by like fluffy dreams,
As sunlight streams in golden beams.

The breeze whispers secrets in my ear,
As nature's symphony I hear,
The rustling leaves, the chirping birds,
A melody that needs no words.

The world around is full of wonder,
A masterpiece to always ponder,
From mountains high to oceans deep,
Nature's beauty we can forever keep.
