Q: i would like a poem 
A: In fields of green and skies of blue,
A world of wonder waits for you,
Where flowers dance and birds take flight,
And dreams take shape in the starry night.

With every step, a story unfolds,
Of tales untold and secrets untold,
And in this world of endless delight,
The heart finds peace and the soul takes flight.

So let us wander, you and I,
Through this world beneath the sky,
And find the magic in every day,
In every moment, come what may.
