Q: 
A: Alright, here's a short poem about the beauty of nature:

The sun rises over the hills so green,
A world of wonder that's often unseen,
The rustling leaves, the chirping birds,
A symphony of nature, with no words.

The flowers bloom, their colors bright,
A wondrous sight, a pure delight,
The scent of fresh air, the touch of breeze,
Nature's beauty, a soulful ease.

The world is vast, and nature's grand,
A place of peace, where we can stand,
To see the beauty, to hear its call,
And cherish it forever, one and all.
