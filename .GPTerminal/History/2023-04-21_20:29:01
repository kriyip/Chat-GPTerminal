Q: 
A: Sure, here's a short poem about Linux:

Linux, the open-source wonder,
A system built for all to ponder.
Secure, stable, and free,
It empowers users like you and me.

From servers to desktops,
It's a system that never stops.
With its command-line interface,
There's no task it can't face.

Linux, a world of possibilities,
A community of shared utilities.
It's more than just an operating system,
It's a philosophy that never succumbs.
