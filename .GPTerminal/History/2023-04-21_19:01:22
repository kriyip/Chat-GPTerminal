Q: 
A: Here's a short poem about Linux:

In the world of code and commands,
Linux reigns supreme and commands.
Free and open, it invites all
To join its ranks and heed the call.

Behind the screens, it works its might,
A force of nature, shining bright.
With Linux as our trusted guide,
The future of tech is open wide.
