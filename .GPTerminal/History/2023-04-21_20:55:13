A: Here's a short poem about mango:

Golden, sweet, and ripe,
The mango is a juicy delight.
Its flesh so soft and succulent,
A taste that's truly heaven-sent.

With hues of orange and yellow,
This fruit is nature's finest fellow.
Its scent so fragrant and fresh,
A tropical treat that's simply the best.

So let us savor each succulent bite,
And enjoy the mango's pure delight.

Q: 
A: An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network has a chain-like structure of repeating LSTM blocks. Each block has a set of gates that regulate the flow of information: an input gate, output gate, and forget gate. These gates control the information that enters and exits the block, allowing the network to selectively remember or forget information over time. The cell state, which acts as a memory, is passed from one block to the next, allowing the network to maintain long-term dependencies.
