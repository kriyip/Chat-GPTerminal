Q: I would like a poem 
A: Amidst the chaos of our days,
We seek a moment to amaze,
With words that dance and sing,
And lift our spirits on high.

The world can be a daunting place,
Full of strife and endless race,
But poetry can soothe the soul,
And make us feel whole once again.

So let us revel in the beauty,
Of language that is truly free,
And find the magic in the mundane,
That makes life worth living each day.

Q: e 
A: E is a letter of the alphabet,
It comes after D and before F, you bet.
It's used in words like egg, elephant, and end,
And is the most commonly used letter in the English language, my friend.
