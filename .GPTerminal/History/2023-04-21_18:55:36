Q: 
A: Here's a short poem about Linux:

In the land of code and command,
Where hackers roam and servers stand,
A penguin waddles to and fro,
A symbol of Linux, don't you know?

With open source and endless might,
This OS is a developer's delight.
From servers high to phones so small,
Linux powers them all.

So let us raise a glass and cheer,
For the software that we hold dear.
Long live Linux, strong and true,
A world of possibilities it shall pursue.
