Q: 
A: PCA stands for Principal Component Analysis. It is a statistical technique used to reduce the complexity of a dataset by identifying the underlying patterns and relationships between variables. PCA transforms the original variables into a new set of variables, called principal components, which are linearly uncorrelated and capture the maximum amount of variance in the data. This allows for easier visualization and analysis of the data.
