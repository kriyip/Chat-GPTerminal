Q: 
A: PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a technique used for dimensionality reduction in data analysis. The goal of PCA is to transform a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional space while retaining as much of the original variance as possible. It does this by identifying the principal components, which are linear combinations of the original features that explain the most variance in the data. These principal components are ordered by the amount of variance they explain, with the first component explaining the most variance. PCA can be used for data visualization, noise reduction, and feature extraction.
