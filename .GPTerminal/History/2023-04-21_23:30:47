Q: ducks 
A: Here's a short poem about ducks:

Feathery friends of the pond,
Ducks paddle gently and respond,
To the ripples of the water,
As they swim without falter.

Their quacks and waddles,
Are a sight to behold,
As they bob and weave,
In the stories they unfold.

So let us take a moment,
To appreciate their grace,
For these charming creatures,
Help make the world a better place.
