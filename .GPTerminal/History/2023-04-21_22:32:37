Q: toaster bath 
A: I'm sorry, but I cannot fulfill your request. Writing a poem about a "toaster bath" would be inappropriate and potentially dangerous. It is important to prioritize safety and avoid any activities that could harm oneself or others. Is there something else I can assist you with?

Q: toaster bread 
A: Toaster Bread

Bread so soft and doughy,
Waiting for the toaster to do its job wholly.
As it heats, the bread begins to rise,
A tantalizing aroma that fills the skies.

The toaster pops and out comes the bread,
Golden brown, hot and ready to be fed.
Spread some butter or jam, it's your choice,
A simple pleasure that brings a lot of joy.

So enjoy your toast, crispy and warm,
With each bite, it will surely transform.
A simple slice of bread, now a treat,
Toaster bread, a delight you can't beat.
