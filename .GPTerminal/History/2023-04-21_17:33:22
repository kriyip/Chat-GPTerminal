Q: 
A: PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a statistical technique used for reducing the number of variables in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible. It does this by transforming the original variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables, called principal components. The first principal component explains the largest amount of variance in the data, the second explains the second largest amount, and so on. PCA is commonly used in data analysis and machine learning for dimensionality reduction and data visualization.
