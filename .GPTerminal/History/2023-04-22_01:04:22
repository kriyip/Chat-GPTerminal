Q: write me a poem about leather jackets 
A: Leather jackets, oh so fine  
A timeless piece that's always in line  
With its sleek and rugged appeal  
It's no wonder it's such a steal  

The scent of leather, rich and bold  
A symbol of a story untold  
It's a garment that commands respect  
And gives the wearer an added effect  

Whether riding on a motorcycle  
Or walking with a confident stroll  
A leather jacket is a statement made  
A fashion choice that will never fade  

So don that jacket, wear it well  
With every step, you'll surely tell  
A bold and daring tale of life  
With a leather jacket, it's all in strife.
