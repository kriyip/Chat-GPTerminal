Q: 
A: Here's a short poem about Linux:

In the world of computers and tech,
There's an operating system that's a speck,
Linux, it's called, with code open-source,
It's free and powerful, it's the boss.

With a terminal that's sleek and clean,
Commands that are precise and keen,
Linux is a world of its own,
A place where innovation has grown.

From servers to phones, it's everywhere,
Linux is the future, the answer to the prayer,
Of those who seek freedom and control,
Linux is a blessing, a true console.
