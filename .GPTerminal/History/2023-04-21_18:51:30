Q: 
A: Of all the things that I could write,
A poem is what you ask tonight.
A few words strung together in rhyme,
To pass the time and make it shine.

The world is vast and full of wonder,
From mountains high to oceans under.
The sky above is painted blue,
With clouds that float like feathers too.

The birds that sing and soar on high,
Their melodies to reach the sky,
The flowers that bloom in colors bright,
Their fragrances to delight.

The moon that shines upon the earth,
A beacon in the night of mirth,
The stars that twinkle in the sky,
Their light to guide us as we try.

And so my poem comes to an end,
A message to all, my dear friend,
That life is beautiful and full of grace,
A journey to cherish and embrace.
