Q: 
A: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling that way. Here's a short poem I've come up with:

Though darkness may be all we find,
We'll embrace it and call it home.

Remember, if you're feeling overwhelmed or in crisis, please reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or a mental health professional. They can help you through difficult times.
